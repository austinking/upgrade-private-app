Download and install the latest version of a binary application,
which is released via a private repo on github.

Usage:
	upgrade-private-app <username> <project> <filename> <path-to-CLI-app>
	upgrade-private-app -h | --help
	upgrade-private-app --version

username	Github username or organization
project		Github repository
filename	Filename for the released archive file.

		Example: sekrit-build.tgz

path-to-CLI-app	Path to the binary application you want to install.

		Example: _output/darwin/amd64/sekrit-app is the full path
		inside of sekrit-build.tgz to a CLI app named sekrit-app

-h --help	Show this screen.
--version	Show version.

This is kind of a hack and several assumptions are baked in.
Patches welcome ;)

Assumptions: the filename must be a compressed tar file, the CLI app must already be installed, the CLI app filename must be the same as the end of the appDirPath.

Recommended usage is to wrap this in a shell alias.

Example bash set:

	alias upgrade-sekrit-app="upgrade-private-app exampleco sekrit-app sekrit-build.tgz _output/darwin/amd64/sekrit-app"

After installing that in ~/.bash_profile, now you can just use upgrade-sekrit-app form the CLI.
